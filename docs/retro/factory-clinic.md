# The "Which Factory?" Clinic — Lab 4, Part D

## D1 — The experiment: what does a fourth theme cost? · 8 pts

The Abstract Factory's whole claim is *"adding a new family is cheap and touches nothing
else."* Claims like that should be measured, not believed.

**Add a fourth theme.** Anything you like — Fungal, Drowned, Clockwork. It needs a kit class,
a couple of monster blueprints in `monsters.json`, and loot.

Before you start, **commit your current work** so `git diff --stat` is meaningful.

| Question | Your answer                                    |
|---|------------------------------------------------|
| How many **new** files did you create? | 1                                              |
| How many **existing** files did you modify? | 3                                              |
| Which existing files? | config.json, monsters.json, ThemeRegistry.java |
| Did `GameWorld.java` change? | No                                             |
| Did any `RoomPopulator` subclass change? | No                                             |
| Did `Monster`, `Room`, or `DungeonLevel` change? | No                                             |

**Paste the output of `git diff --stat`:**

```bash
$ git diff --stat

**In two or three sentences: what does that number tell you about the Open/Closed
Principle — "open for extension, closed for modification"? Was it satisfied, and how do you
know from evidence rather than from a definition?**


> Set `dungeonDepth` to 4 in `config.json` and run it, so you can see your fourth theme.
> Then set it back to 3 before you open the PR.

## D2 — Classification · 12 pts

For each scenario: which of the three applies? Answer **Simple Factory**, **Factory Method**,
**Abstract Factory**, or **none of them** — and give a one-sentence reason.

| # | Scenario | Which?           | Why                                                                                                                                                               |
|---|---|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | One place in the code turns a monster id string into a `Monster`, so `new Monster` appears once | Simple Factory   | Simple Factory puts all monster creation in one place so code only needs one new monster statement but the other classes use the factory to create monsters by ID |
| 2 | A boss room, a treasure room and an ordinary room each fill themselves differently, but always in the same order: prose, then monsters, then a chest | Factory Method   | Each room creates its own indidviual content while the population process stays the same.                                                                         |
| 3 | An ice level must contain ice monsters AND ice loot AND ice prose, never a mix | Abstract Factory | It creates family related objects designed to work together.                                                                                                      |
| 4 | Week 9: a weapon can be made flaming, then vampiric, then blessed, in any combination | None             |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5 | Week 12: save files must be written as JSON now and possibly as XML later, with matched reader and writer | Abstract Factory | Abstract Factory because it creates a matching family of related objects—a reader and writer for the same save-file format.                                       |
| 6 | A method returns a `Player` object, built from the name typed at startup | None             |                                                                                                                                                                   |

> Scenarios 4 and 6 are traps. One is a different pattern entirely; the other is not a pattern

## D3 — The distinction, in your own words · 5 pts

**Simple Factory is not one of the Gang of Four patterns.** Your textbook says so explicitly
before it teaches Factory Method.

**In three or four sentences: what can Factory Method do that Simple Factory cannot?** Do not
define either one. Describe a change someone might ask you to make, and explain why it would
be easy with one and awkward with the other.

It makes it much easier to add new room types because each subclass can handle its own creation logic. However, a Simple
Factory you would have to modify the central factory if you ever add something new. 

## D4 — One honest question

What is still blurry about these three patterns? A specific confusion is worth more to me
than a confident summary.

In my honest opinion I have a pretty good understanding with how the patterns work so far!
